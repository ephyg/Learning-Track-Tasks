# Learning Track Task 3: Test API on Postman

This is a simple API testing using Postman. The API I used is the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) API.


## Guidelines to check the API
1. clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ephyg/Learning-Track-Tasks.git
2. Open Postman
3. import the collection from the `postman_collection.json` file
4. Open the collection and run the requests
